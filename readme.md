# GIT

## First new section

we will have to complete this later on


## Another new section

Here are some steps to follow:

1. Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd repository
    ```

3. Create a new branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b new-branch
    ```

4. Make the necessary changes to the code or files.

5. Stage your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    ```

7. Push your changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin new-branch
    ```

8. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch.

Remember to replace `username` and `repository` with the appropriate values for your repository.


## Understanding git internals

open your local .git folder and explore the structure and some of the files resp `blobs`inside by using the read.py script

```bash
# adapt the blob file names
python read.py
```


## Yet another section

```python
def dummy_function():
    # Add your code here
    pass
```
